Q: What are the two main layers of an operating system?
A: An operating system consists of two layers:
- Operating system kernel
- Applications layer

Q: What is the primary function of the kernel layer?
A: The kernel layer communicates directly with hardware components such as CPU, memory, and other hardware components.

Q: How do different Linux distributions relate to the kernel?
A: Different Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint) all use the same Linux kernel but implement different:
- Graphical user interfaces
- File systems
- Applications on top of the kernel

Q: Why can Linux distributions look and feel different despite using the same kernel?
A: They can look and feel different because while they share the same Linux kernel, they implement different:
- Applications
- User interfaces
- System configurations
Even though the underlying kernel remains the same

Q: Can you name some examples of Linux distributions mentioned?
A: Yes, the examples mentioned are:
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Linux Mint

Q: What does Docker virtualize in an operating system?
A: Docker virtualizes only the applications layer. When you download a Docker image, it contains:
- The applications layer of the operating system
- Additional applications installed on top of it
- It uses the kernel of the host system, as it doesn't have its own kernel

Q: How does virtualization in Virtual Machines differ from Docker?
A: Virtual machines virtualize the complete operating system, meaning:
- They have their own applications layer
- They have their own kernel
- They don't use the host system's kernel

Q: What are the main differences between Docker and Virtual Machines?
A: There are three key differences:
- Size: Docker images are typically a few megabytes, while VM images can be several gigabytes
- Speed: Docker containers start much faster than VMs since they don't need to boot up a complete OS
- Compatibility: VMs can run on any host OS, while Docker has some compatibility limitations

Q: What compatibility issues exist with Docker?
A: Docker faces compatibility challenges such as:
- Linux-based Docker images might not be compatible with Windows kernel (versions below Windows 10)
- Similar issues exist with older Mac versions
- Users need to check if their host can run Docker natively
- Docker Toolbox is used as a workaround to abstract away kernel compatibility issues

Q: What is Docker Toolbox and when is it used?
A: Docker Toolbox is:
- A technology that abstracts away the kernel
- Used to make it possible for hosts to run different Docker images
- Implemented as a workaround when native Docker compatibility isn't available
- Particularly useful for older Windows and Mac systems
