Q: What is Docker Hub?
A: Docker Hub is a repository where:
- All artifacts are images (not containers)
- Contains Docker official images
- Users can pull images to their local machine
- Images have different versions/tags available

Q: How do you work with Docker images?
A: You can:
- Pull images using docker pull [image-name]
- View local images using docker images command
- See different versions/tags of images in Docker Hub
- The "latest" tag is used by default if no version is specified

Q: How do you create and manage containers?
A: Several key commands:
- docker run [image-name] - creates and starts a container
- docker ps - shows running containers
- docker ps -a - shows all containers (running and stopped)
- docker stop [container-id] - stops a container
- docker start [container-id] - starts a stopped container

Q: What's the difference between attached and detached modes?
A: Two running modes:
- Attached mode (default): Shows container output in terminal, stops with Ctrl+C
- Detached mode (-d flag): Runs in the background, returns container ID
- Example: docker run -d redis

Q: How can you run multiple versions of the same application?
A: You can:
- Pull different versions using tags (e.g., redis:4.0 vs redis:5.0.6)
- Run multiple containers with different versions simultaneously
- Each container can use the same port internally without conflict
- Use docker run [image-name]:[tag] to run specific versions
