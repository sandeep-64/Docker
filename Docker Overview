Q: Why is it important to understand container basics first?
A: It's essential to understand the basics of containers before jumping into advanced concepts like creating projects with containers or container interactions.

Q: What is the recommended prerequisite for learning about containers?
A: Learining virtual machines is recommended, as containers are an advancement to virtual machines, similar to how virtual machines were an advancement to physical servers.

Q: What was the main problem with physical servers that led to virtualization?
A: Resources (CPU, RAM, and Hardware) weren't being used completely on physical servers, which was especially problematic for organizations with thousands of servers paying for unused resources.

Q: What is virtualization and how does it solve the resource problem?
A: Virtualization, implemented through hypervisors, creates multiple virtual machines or virtual servers on top of physical servers, allowing for better resource utilization through logical separation.

Q: What makes virtual machines secure?
A: Virtual machines are secure because each application runs on its own VM with its own operating system, creating tight logical separation even though they run on the same physical server.

Q: Why did organizations need to move from virtualization to containerization despite virtualization working well?
A: Even after moving to virtual machines, organizations realized they weren't using the complete capacity of VMs. For example, if a VM had 25GB RAM, an application might only use 10GB RAM and 6 CPU at peak load, wasting significant resources.

Q: What example was given to explain resource allocation in virtual machines?
A: A physical server with 100GB RAM and 100 CPU could be divided into 4 VMs, each with 25GB RAM, but applications might only use a fraction (like 10GB RAM and 6 CPU) even at maximum threshold load.

Q: What is a common scenario with EC2 instances that demonstrates resource waste?
A: Most users rarely see "running out of memory" errors on their EC2 instances, indicating that they're using very few resources while paying for much more.

Q: Why is resource waste a significant problem for large organizations?
A: For organizations using around 1 million EC2 instances, having most instances wasting resources results in heavy financial losses.

Q: How do containers compare to virtual machines in terms of security?
A: Virtual machines are more secure than containers because:
- VMs have a full operating system providing complete isolation
- Containers don't have a complete operating system
- Containers have logical isolation but it's not complete
- Containers can talk to each other and the host operating system to share resources

Here are the Q&A from this part of the transcript:

Q: What are the two ways to create containers?
A: 
1. Model 1: Creating containers directly on top of physical servers with an operating system and Docker/containerization platform
2. Model 2: Creating containers on top of virtual machines (like EC2 instances)

Q: Why do organizations prefer Model 2 over Model 1?
A: Organizations prefer Model 2 because:
- Less maintenance overhead
- No need to maintain physical data centers
- No need for dedicated system administrators for physical servers
- Most organizations are now using cloud providers

Q: Why are containers considered lightweight in nature?
A: Containers are lightweight because:
- They don't have a complete operating system
- They share resources from the base/host operating system
- They only contain minimal operating system components (base image)
- They are a package of application + application libraries + system dependencies

Q: What is the size difference between virtual machine snapshots and container images?
A: 
- Virtual machine snapshots are typically 1-3GB or more
- Container images are much smaller, around 100MB-500MB depending on dependencies and base image usage

Q: What makes containers easy to ship or transfer?
A: Containers are easy to ship because they are lightweight in nature, making them easier to move from one place to another, such as deploying to container platforms or Kubernetes.

Q: What components make up a Docker container?
A: A Docker container consists of:
- Base image with system dependencies
- Application code
- Application libraries
- System dependencies/packages


Q: What is the basic workflow of creating a Docker container?
A: The workflow consists of three main steps:
1. Write a Dockerfile
2. Convert Dockerfile to Docker image using docker build command
3. Convert Docker image to container using docker run command

Q: What is the role of Docker Engine in containerization?
A: Docker Engine:
- Receives all inputs and commands
- Converts Dockerfile to Docker image
- Creates containers from images
- Manages the container lifecycle

Q: What is a major drawback of Docker Engine?
A: Docker Engine is a single point of failure (SPF) - if the Docker Engine goes down, all containers will stop working and won't respond.

Q: What is Builder and why was it created?
A: Builder is a tool created to solve several Docker challenges:
- Addresses the single point of failure issue
- Reduces the problem of multiple layers in Docker images
- Offers more simplicity
- Works well with Kubernetes
- Allows using shell scripts instead of Dockerfiles
- Can create Docker images or any OCI-compliant images

Q: How does Builder differ from Docker in terms of configuration?
A: Instead of writing Dockerfiles, Builder allows users to write shell scripts containing Builder commands to create images.
