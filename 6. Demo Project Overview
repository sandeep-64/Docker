Q: What is a typical Docker development workflow?
A: A typical workflow consists of three main stages:
1. Local Development
2. CI/CD Pipeline
3. Development Server Deployment

Q: How is Docker used in local development?
A:
- Developers write application code locally (e.g., JavaScript)
- Database (e.g., MongoDB) runs in Docker container instead of local installation
- Additional tools (e.g., MongoDB Express UI) run in separate containers
- Benefits: No local DB installation needed, consistent environment, easy management

Q: How does the CI/CD process work with Docker?
A:
1. Developer pushes code to Git repository
2. CI tool (e.g., Jenkins) triggered automatically
3. CI process:
   - Builds application
   - Creates Docker image
   - Pushes image to private repository
   - Triggers deployment

Q: Why use a private Docker repository?
A:
- Security: Keeps proprietary code and images private
- Access Control: Only authorized users/systems can access
- Company Control: Maintains internal control over image distribution

Q: What happens during deployment to development server?
A:
1. Server pulls required images:
   - Custom application image from private repository
   - Dependencies (like MongoDB) from Docker Hub
2. Containers are configured to communicate
3. Application becomes available for testing

Q: What are the advantages of this Docker workflow?
A:
- Environment Consistency: Same setup across development, testing, deployment
- Easy Management: Simple database and application management
- Quick Setup: New team members can start quickly
- Isolated Testing: Containerized environment for testing
- Simplified Dependencies: No need to install databases or services locally

Q: What's the basic application setup in this example?
A:
- Simple JavaScript application with:
  - index.html for frontend
  - Node.js backend serving on port 3000
  - User profile page with edit functionality
  - Currently no data persistence (changes lost on refresh)

Q: Why do we need Docker containers for this development setup?
A:
- Need database for data persistence
- Docker provides easy way to add MongoDB without local installation
- Additional container (Mongo Express) provides database UI management
- Makes development process easier and more efficient

Q: How do we set up the required Docker containers?
A:
1. Pull required images from Docker Hub:
   ```
   docker pull mongo
   docker pull mongo-express
   ```
2. Verify images are available locally:
   ```
   docker images
   ```
   Should show both mongo and mongo-express images

Q: What's the purpose of Mongo Express?
A:
- Provides web-based UI for MongoDB management
- Makes it easier to:
  - View database contents
  - Monitor application updates
  - Manage database without command line
- Runs in separate container connected to MongoDB container

Q: What are the next steps after pulling the images?
A:
1. Run MongoDB container
2. Run Mongo Express container
3. Configure containers to communicate with each other
4. Connect application to MongoDB container
5. Test persistence by saving and refreshing the page

This setup creates a complete development environment with:
- Frontend application
- Backend server
- Database (MongoDB in Docker)
- Database management UI (Mongo Express in Docker)
